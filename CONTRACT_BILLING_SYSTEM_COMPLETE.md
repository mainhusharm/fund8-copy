## üéØ HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

### Contract Signing Flow:

1. **Admin creates challenge account**
   - `credentials_visible = false` (credentials hidden)
   - User receives notification

2. **User navigates to Dashboard**
   - Sees "Sign Contract" warning banner
   - Credentials section is hidden
   - Large "Sign Contract" button displayed

3. **User clicks "Sign Contract"**
   - Redirects to `/contract/:challengeId`
   - Loads contract signing page

4. **Contract Signing Page Shows:**
   - User information form (name, DOB, address, phone, country)
   - Scrollable contract text (full legal agreement)
   - 8 required checkboxes (all must be checked):
     * Terms and Conditions
     * Risk Disclosure
     * Privacy Policy
     * Refund Policy
     * Trading Rules
     * Age Confirmation (18+)
     * Accurate Information
     * Anti-Money Laundering
   - Electronic signature field (type full name)

   - All form fields required

6. **On Submit:**
   - Records IP address and timestamp
   - Stores full contract text (versioned)
   - Creates contract record in database

     * `contract_signed = true`
     * `contract_id = [contract_id]`
     * `credentials_visible = true` ‚úÖ
     * `credentials_released_at = now()`
   - Generates PDF (via Edge Function)
   - Sends confirmation email with PDF attached
   - Shows success modal with credentials

7. **Success Modal Displays:**
   - ‚úÖ "Contract Signed Successfully!"
   - MT5 Login, Password, Server
   - Copy buttons

## üìù NOTES

**Database Schema:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED
- All tables created
- All functions created
- All triggers created
- All indexes created
- All RLS policies active

**Contract Text:** The full legal contract text template (from your requirements) should be stored in the application code or as a Supabase function that returns the formatted text with user data interpolated.

**PDF Generation:** Recommend using an external service like:
- PDFMonkey (easiest, templates)
- DocRaptor (HTML to PDF)
- Puppeteer (self-hosted, most flexible)
- jsPDF (client-side, lightweight)

**Color Scheme (Fund8r Branding):**
- Purple: #8B5CF6
- Dark Blue: #1E3A8A
- Blue: #3B82F6
- Gold: #FCD34D
- White: #FFFFFF

**Lion Icon:** Use a simplified geometric lion design in gold with purple mane, or use an icon from Lucide React styled appropriately.
